          <div class="tap-info" id="amy">
            <p>A cute, sweet and optimist, 8 year old girl. Amy is very intelligent, and because of her ignorance of how the world was in the past, she is rather naive to understand how bad it is today.</p>
            <p>Although Amy is full of energy and ambitions, the restricted space and freedom has made her develop a taste for literature and other hobbies, such as television programs. She is very sweet with her family and friends, but she becomes passionate and serious when she is in "adventure mode".</p>

            <p>Environmental activist, 35 years old. She always knew that the bad habits of mankind, would cause environmental damage. She believes that climate change is a matter of negligence, not destination.</p>
            <p>She is confident and has an optimistic attitude towards the possibility of change and progress. She is much more serious than her husband, but they often laugh and play together.</p>
            <p>She loves books, is realistic and a natural leader. She is an active member of several conservation groups and directs some of them. Although the world is not what it was, she has not given up and tries to protect the planet within her possibilities.</p>

            <p>Retired engineer, 40 years old. He dedicated his professional career to structural engineering. Unlike his father, he did believe in climate change since he was young, but to him, the world was too damaged and all I could be done was to be prepare for the future.</p>
            <p>Although he quit his job, he continues to design concepts and products for his wife´s environmental movement, which he supports on her political and social efforts. His main motivation is to improve the world for his daughter. He is sympathetic and compassionate, although he likes to delve into his work rather than in anything else.</p>

            <p>A 70 year old man who spent most of his life denying climate change. After seeing and experiencing the disastrous consequences, he came to his senses. His body language reflects his frustration and regret about the current state of the world.</p>
            <p>When he talks to Amy he tries to be cheerful and optimistic, but sometimes his shame comes to light. He behaves distant and bitter with the rest of the family; all though he loves them and cares a lot.  He is not really conservative, but he struggles to get out of his comfort zone.</p>
